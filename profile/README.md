Hey friend! 😌

This is a space that's a bit more experimental than the stuff you'd see on my normal [Github profile]. It includes more recent explorations, as well as some archives of older things I've made (like a janky [JQuery knock-off][ally] I made while I was 13 years old). As such, I wouldn't take any of the repos here very seriously. They're all [hacky][cakeday], [incompletely][cherry], or just things I made for [fun][intro]. I'm a bit of a historian/preservationist at heart, so the majority of things here are just things I would've otherwise deleted...but it's not any fun to look back at things if they don't exist anymore. 😝

Stay nerdy.
