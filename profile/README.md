# Hey friend 😌

This is a space that's a bit more experimental than the stuff you'd see on my normal
[Github profile]. It includes more recent explorations, as well as some archives of older
things I've made (like a [terrible JQuery alternative] I made while I was only like 13
years old). As such, I wouldn't take any of the repos here very seriously. They're all
hacky, incompletely, or just things I made for fun. I'm a bit of a
historian/preservationist at heart, so the majority of things here are just things I
would've otherwise deleted...but it's not any fun to look back at things if they don't
exist anymore. 😝

Stay nerdy.
